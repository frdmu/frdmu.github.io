# Introduction 
&ensp;&ensp;Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. Consensus algorithms allow a collection of machines to work as a coherent group that can survive the failures of some of its members.
# Replicated state machines
&ensp;&ensp;Consensus algorithms typically arise in the context of replicated state machines. Replicated state machines are typically implemented using a replicated log, as shown in Figure 1.
