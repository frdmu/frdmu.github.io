<p>  Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. Consensus algorithms allow a collection of machines to work as a coherent group that can survive the failures of some of its members.</p>
<h1 id="replicated-state-machines">Replicated state machines</h1>
<p>  Consensus algorithms typically arise in the context of replicated state machines. Replicated state machines are typically implemented using a replicated log, as shown in Figure 1.
